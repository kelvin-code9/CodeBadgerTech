#### Coding is not all about watching someone teach you everything. You need to be able to find solutions to problems independently. You get the concepts in class and then apply them to scenarios we didn’t cover in class. With this mindset, complete the following assignment:

* Research the contenteditable Attribute:

* Investigate the function of the contenteditable attribute in HTML.
  Understand how it can be used to make elements editable directly in the  browser.

* Create a new HTML file named contenteditable.html.
 This page should include a text with the content "You can edit me".
 Style this text to be blue and set its font size to 25px.
 Ensure the text is editable using the contenteditable attribute.
