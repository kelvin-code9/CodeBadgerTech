## Source Code Management
Source Code Management (SCM) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. It is an essential aspect of modern software development, enabling multiple developers to collaborate efficiently on the same project.

### Key Functions of Source Code Management

**Version Control:** SCM systems keep a record of every change made to the codebase. This includes who made the change, when it was made, and what was changed. This allows developers to revert to previous versions if needed (you can see it like a time machine).

***Collaboration:*** SCM tools enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. Changes from different developers can be merged, and conflicts can be resolved.

***Branching and Merging:*** Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently of the main codebase. Once the work is complete, branches can be merged back into the main codebase.

***Change Tracking:*** SCM provides detailed logs of all changes, helping developers understand the history and rationale behind specific changes. This is crucial for debugging and improving the code.

Backup and Recovery: By maintaining a history of changes, SCM systems serve as a backup, allowing recovery of code if something goes wrong.

### Popular Source Code Management Tools
* ***Git:*** A distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes and collaborate with others

### What is GitHub
GitHub is an online platform that helps you store and manage your code. It is like a social media site for developers where you can share your code, work together with others, and keep track of changes to your projects.

```In simple words, git is the tool for version control on your local machine. while github is the website where you store your code```

### How To Create A Repository
A repository (often shortened to "repo") is a storage space where your project's files and the history of changes made to those files are kept. Think of it as a digital project folder.

### What Is A Readme File
A README file is a text file (usually in Markdown format) that is included in a project repository. It provides essential information about the project, such as what it does, how to set it up, how to use it, and any other pertinent details. The README file is often the first thing someone will look at when they visit your repository.

to create a Readme just create a file with the extention .md (md stands for markdown)


### What Is A Commit Message
A commit message is a short description that explains the changes made in a specific update (or "commit") to a software project managed with version control systems like Git. It helps team members understand the purpose and context of each change made to the codebase. To write a good commit message, just make sure that the message explians the changes you mad in one sentence
